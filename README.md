# 2025-Fall-Final
This is the repository for your Fall Final (2025). In this repo you will find a number of files. You will use these files and create new files to meet the requirements the final. Start with the README.md


Follow these steps:
1. After setting up your local git repo, make your initial commit. The message should be "Batman". Remember to make commits as you continue.
2. Create a new file called "WrittenAnswers.txt"
3. Inside this new file, answer the following questions. You can reference your own previous code. No googling/looking up info.
   - Explain your Tower of Hanoi Recursion. Why does it work no matter the number of discs?
   - What is the purpose of MinMax?
   - How did you implement the MinMax algorithim in your Tic-Tac-Toe Project? Give specific line numbers. Explain why your code is indeed a MinMax algorithm.
   - Explain what Alpha-Beta pruning is. What is it used for? Why is it needed?
   - Explain haw you implemebted Alpha-Beta pruning in your Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe program. Give specific line numbers.
   - What is the importance of good comments in code? Can you give good/bad examples? Perhaps from your own code?
   - Pick a day that you have not completed for this years Advent of Code. Give a write up explaining how you think you can solve it. This is just a proposal/pseudocode for how you would go about solving it.

4. Create a new Java program to complete the challenge called BeforeYouGo.txt
5. Create a new branch called "Formal". Move into this branch for the rest of step 5.
   
   Create a new txt file and name it FormalProposal.txt.
   Select a day from this year's Advent of Code that you have not yet completed. Instead of writing the final code, your task is to write a technical design proposal for how you would solve it.

   Requirements:

   - Problem Summary: Briefly summarize the input format and the goal of the puzzle in your own words.
   - Algorithm Design: Describe your proposed algorithmic approach.
   - Will you use iteration, recursion, dynamic programming, graph traversal (BFS/DFS), or simulation? Explain why this approach is suitable for the problem.
   - Data Structures: Identify the specific data structures (e.g., hash maps, sets, 2D arrays, priority queues) you plan to use and explain why they are necessary.
   -Pseudocode: Provide pseudocode for your solution. Focus on logic flow rather than syntax.
   - Complexity Analysis: Give a ballpark estimate for  Big O time complexity of your proposed solution. Discuss potential edge cases or performance bottlenecks given the input size.
6. Switch back to your main branch and merge with "Formal".
7. When you are done with all of these steps or have run out of time, push to the remote repository to submit your final.
